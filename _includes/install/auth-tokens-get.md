## Overview of Magento authentication {#auth-overview}
The `repo.magento.com` repository, where Magento 2 and third-party component Composer packages are stored, requires authentication. To provide secure authentication, we enable you to generate a pair 32-character *authentication tokens* you can use to access the repository. You generate, access, and can also delete or regenerate your keys using Magento Marketplace.

To get your authentication keys:

1.	Go to [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com){:target="_blank"}.
2.	Click **Sign In** and enter your login credentials.

	If you don't have a free account, click **Create an Account**.

2.	After you log in, click **My Access Keys** as the following figure shows.

3.	If you already have keys, use the **Public key** as your user name and the **Private key** as your password.
3.	To create a new key pair, click **Create a New Access Key**.

	The following figure shows an example.

	![]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/install_mkpl_access-keys-detail.png){:width="500px"}
4.	When prompted, enter a descritive name to identify the key pair.
5.	Click **Generate New**.

	Use the **Public key** as your user name and the **Private key** as your password.

#### Manage your authentiation keys
You can optionally disable or delete authentication keys you created. For example, you can disable or delete keys for security reasons after someone left your organization.

*	Disable keys: Click **Disable**. You can do this if you want to suspend use of your keys.
*	Enable a previously disabled key: Click **Enable**.
*	Delete keys: Click **Delete**.

You cannot delete or disable keys you created by logging in to `magento.com`. To manage those keys:

1.	[Log in](https://www.magentocommerce.com/products/customer/account/login){:target="_blank"} to your `magento.com` account.
2.	In the top navigation bar, click **Connect**.
3.	In the left pane, click **Secure keys**.

4.	Enable or disable the desired keys.
