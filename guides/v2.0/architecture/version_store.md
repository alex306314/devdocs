<h2 id="verpol">Where is version information stored?</h2>


Both software version numbers and product version numbers are found in the `version` field of the component's or metapackage's `composer.json` file.


For example, you can declare software version as a version of the component:

<pre>

"name": "acme/foo",

"version": 1.2.0

</pre>

Or you can use it to declare a dependency on a particular version of a component:

<pre>

"require": {

   "acme/foo": "1.2.*",

   "acme/bar": "2.2.0"

}

</pre>
