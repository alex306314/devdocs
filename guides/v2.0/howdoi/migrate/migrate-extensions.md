## Migrate extensions from Magento 1 to Magento 2

Magento 1 extensions in most cases will not be compatible with Magento 2 code. Many extension providers offer updated versions of their products available for purchase or download on the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions.html" target="_blank">Magento Marketplace</a>. 

Use this chance to review the list of extensions. To simplify future upgrades, install only the extensions that are required for your business.
