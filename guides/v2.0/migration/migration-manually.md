## Data types

There are three types of data that need to be manually migrated:

*	Media

*	Storefront design

*	Admin users

*	ACLs

## Media

This section discusses how to manually migrate media files.

### Media files stored in the database

This section applies to you *only* if you store media files in the Magento database. This step should be performed before <a href="{{page.baseurl}}migration/migration-migrate-data.html">migration of data</a>:

1.	Log in to the Magento 1 Admin Panel as an administrator.
2.	Click **System** > **Configuration** > ADVANCED > **System**.
3.	In the right pane, scroll to **Storage Configuration for Media**.
4.	From the **Select Media Database** list, click the name of your media storage database.
5.	Click **Synchronize**.

Then, repeat the same steps in your Magento 2 Admin panel.

### Media files in the file system

All media files (images for products, categories, the WYSIWYG editor, and so on) should be copied manually from `<your Magento 1 install dir>/media` to `<your Magento 2 install dir>/pub/media`.

However, do *not* copy the `.htaccess` files located in the Magento 1 `media` folder. Magento 2 has its own `.htaccess` that should be preserved.

## Storefront design

* Design in files (css, js, templates, XML layouts) changed its location and format

* Layout Updates stored in database. Placed through Magento 1 Admin in CMS Pages, CMS Widgets, Category Pages and Product Pages

## ACLs (Access Control Lists)

You must manually re-create all:

*	credentials for web services APIs (that is, SOAP, XML-RPC, and REST)

*	administrative user accounts and associate them with access privileges

        You may adjust the time zone for a database entity using the <code>\Migration\Handler\Timezone</code> handler. See the <a href="{{page.baseurl}}migration/migration-migrate-additional.html">Additional info</a> section for more details.
    </p>
</div>
