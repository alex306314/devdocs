## Set up Fastly
[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/why-fastly){:target="_blank"} is required for Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition. It works with Varnish to provide fast caching capabilities and a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets.

See the following sections for more information:

*	[Get your Fastly credentials](#cloud-fastly-creds)
*	[Get started](#cloud-fastly-start)
*	[Install Fastly in your new environment](#cloud-fastly-setup)
*	[Enable Fastly using the Magento Admin](#cloud-fastly-admin)
*	[Configure Fastly](https://github.com/fastly/fastly-magento2/blob/master/Documentation/CONFIGURATION.md#further-configuration-options){:target="_blank"}
*	[Merge your Fastly branch](#cloud-fastly-merge})

### Get your Fastly credentials {#cloud-fastly-creds}
To get Fastly credentials, open a [support ticket]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/get-help.html). We'll provide you with the following information so you can enable Fastly:

*	Fastly API key
*	Fastly service ID

### Get started {#cloud-fastly-start}
Fastly recommends you do your development in its own branch because fine-tuning Fastly can be a complex process, depending on your needs and eCommerce shop size.

In the procedure that follows, make sure you *branch* a new environment; don't use an existing one unless you know this is what you want to do.
