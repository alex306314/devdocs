## Before you get started
These topics discuss what you need to do before you get started using Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition:

*	Understand [Common terminology]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/before/terms.html).
*	Decide which [Git repository]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/before/before-repos.html) to use (the one provided with Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition or a private repository you already use).
