<h2>Magento Community Edition 2.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3)</h2>
We are pleased to present Magento 2.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3). This release candidate build is not intended for production purposes. Instead, it provides the development community opportunities to: 

* preview the new features and fixes that Magento 2.1 GA will contain

* contribute to the Magento 2.1 code base by identifying unresolved issues

* test your 2.0 extensions against 2.1 

We welcome your participation in this process!  Please open any Community Edition issues or Pull Requests on the Community Edition GitHub repository. For more information on how to provide feedback and contribute on GitHub, see <a href="{{page.baseurl}}contributor-guide/contributing.html" target="_blank">Code contributions</a>.

Backward-incompatible changes are documented in <a href="{{page.baseurl}}release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes-2.1.html" target="_blank">Magento 2.1 Backward Incompatible Changes</a>.
 

<h3>Highlights</h3>

Magento Community Edition 2.1 includes several new and exciting features:

* **PayPal enhancements** include PayPal in-context checkout and saved credit cards. In-context checkout helps to increase conversion rates 69 bps by allowing shoppers to pay with PayPal without leaving the merchantâ€™s site. PayPal saved credit cards boost repeat purchases by allowing merchants to securely store credit card information with PayPal so customers do not need to re-enter it in checkout or when reordering items from the Admin interface.
 
* **Braintree enhancements enable merchants to qualify for the simplest set of PCI compliance** requirements by using Braintree Hosted Fields to collect all sensitive cardholder information in checkout. Merchants retain complete control over their checkout style and layout because Braintree uses small, transparent iframes to replace individual payment fields. Merchants can now also access Braintree settlement reports from within the Magento Admin interface.
 
* **Improved management interfaces** make it faster and easier to search for information in the Admin, set up global search synonyms, and create new product, category, and CMS content.

<h3>Known issues</h3>
Magento Community Edition 2.1, Release Candidate 3 includes the following known issues: 

<!--- 54445-->* The process of uninstalling modules using command-line tools unexpectedly stalls. 
**Workaround:** Ensure that your `<magento root>/var/composer_home/auth.json` file contains your authentication keys. You can create an `auth.json` file in one of two ways:

**Method 1:** If you ran Composer commands from CLI before and specified your `repo.magento.com` credentials, you can copy the existing `auth.json` file from your home directory under `"~/.composer/"`


**Method 2:** You can manually create the file using this format:

{% highlight php startinline=true %}

{
    "http-basic": {
        "repo.magento.com": {
            "username": "<public key>",
            "password": "<private key>"
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}


<!--- 54320-->* The Category page displays the former price instead of the current price during scheduled updates.
