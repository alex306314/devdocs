## Magento Community Edition 2.0.10
We are pleased to present Magento Community Edition 2.0.10. This release includes multiple security and functional enhancements as well as enhancements to the Sales API. New Sales API methods allow third party solutions, such as shipping or ERP applications, to use APIs when they create an invoice or shipment. 



Backward-incompatible changes are documented in <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}release-notes/changes_2.0.html" target="_blank">Magento 2.0 Backward Incompatible Changes</a>.

## Highlights

* Patch 2.0.10 is now <i>compatible with MySQL 5.7</i>.

* Patch 2.0.10 introduces <i>two new web APIs (or service contracts) for the Sales module</i> that incorporate functionality into the Sales API that is currently available in the Admin interface. After you install this patch, you’ll be able to use the Sales API `ShipOrder` and `InvoiceOrder` methods to capture payment and ship product. For more information on these API enhancements, see the <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}mrg/ce/Sales/services.html#invoiceorder" target="_blank">Sales API</a> discussion in the <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}mrg/intro.html" target="_blank">Module Reference Guide</a>. 


### Why are we adding new APIs in a patch release?
{:.no_toc} 


<i>These new interfaces will not break any existing customizations or extensions</i>.   See <a href="https://alankent.me/category/magento/" target="_blank">Alan Kent’s blog about Magento</a> for more information about these features and Magento’s use of semantic versioning. 


## Security enhancements

This release includes  enhancements to improve the security of your Magento software. While there are no confirmed attacks related to these issues to date, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. We recommend that you upgrade your existing Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

The following list provides an overview of the security issues fixed in this release. We describe each issue in greater detail in the <a href="https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2010-and-212-security-update" target="_blank">Magento Security Center</a>.
