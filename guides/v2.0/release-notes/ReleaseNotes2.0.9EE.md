## Magento Enterprise Edition 2.0.9
We are pleased to present Magento Enterprise Edition 2.0.9. This release includes several functional fixes.


Backward-incompatible changes are documented in <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}release-notes/changes_2.0.html" target="_blank">Magento 2.0 Backward Incompatible Changes</a>.



### Fixed issues


#### Shopping cart

<!--- 56019/49716 -->* Magento no longer displays an incorrect price in the shopping cart when using multiple shipping addresses.

<!--- 55464/53793 -->* The Minicart Maximum Display Recently Added Item setting now works as expected.  Previously, Magento displayed all the items in the shopping cart, even when the number of items exceeded this limit. <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4750" target="_blank">(GITHUB-4750)</a> 


#### Performance

<!--- 54682 -->* We've improved storefront performance when you use many variations of a configurable product.


#### Miscellaneous

<!--- 55362/45339 -->* Cart Price Rules are now applied as expected to Payment method conditions. Previously, discounts set in Cart Price Rules were not applied during checkout. 


* You can now select Gift Wrapping when purchasing a Grouped product. Previously, Magento did not permit you to select Gift Wrapping for a Grouped product.  <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4852" target="_blank">(GITHUB-4852)</a>


<!--- 55513/51015 -->* You can now save a product for which you've entered no Swatch attribute value when this attribute is not required.  Previously, during product creation, Magento would not save the product unless you added a value to the swatch attribute even with "Values Required" set to No. 
 

<!--- 55465/50026 -->* Attributes of the `salesInvoiceRepository` methods are now correctly type cast. (The datatype is now a float -- not nullable float.)  Previously, due to the use of an incorrect data type cast, Magento would produce an error when calling the `salesInvoiceRepositoryV1GetList` methods. <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/3605" target="_blank">(GITHUB-3605)</a> 


<!--- 55461/54224 -->* We've renamed the Tier Price option on the Advanced Pricing tab to Customer Group Price option. 


<!--- 55441/55055 -->* Tier pricing now works correctly with full page cache. <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5364" target="_blank">(GITHUB-5364)</a>


 

<!--- Omitted (can't be reproduced or won't fix) 48425, 53777, 54721, 54804, 54718, 54647-->

### Known issue

<!--- 52805 -->The Sales API does not currently support all the update operations on objects that you can execute from the Admin panel. (<i>Objects</i> in this context include orders, invoices, shipments, credit memos, and return merchandise authorizations.) 


The Sales API

* supports create, read, delete, and search operations on objects

* does not support updates to order status or payment status. (<i>Order status</i> includes change to processing, shipped, processed, and hold, while <i>payment status</i> includes authorized, charged, reject, and refund.)

You can run these operations from the Admin panel.



### System requirements
Our technology stack is built on PHP and MySQL. Magento 2.0.1 and later supports:

* PHP 5.5.x, where x is 22 or greater

* PHP 5.6.x

* PHP 7.0.2 up to 7.1.0, except for 7.0.5

* MySQL 5.6
