A UI component instance is, basically, a JavaScript object.

A UI component can be configured in `.xml` or `.phtml` or even in `.php`, or created dynamically inside another component. Typically, any UI component instance is bound to some `.html` template.

The usual UI component is seen by the user as an distinct and highly interactive part of the UI: form, field, listing toolbar, button an so on.

UI components are configured using primarily the following:

1. `definition.xml` file: the structure with nodes, nested nodes, options and so on.
2. UI component XML declaration (the instance).
3. [Backend/PHP modifiers]({{page.baseurl}}ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_modifier_concept.md).
4. Configuration inside the JavaScript classes.
