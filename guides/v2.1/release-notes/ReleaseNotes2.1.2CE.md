## Magento Community Edition 2.1.2
We are pleased to present Magento Community Edition 2.1.2. This release includes security enhancements and several functional fixes.


Backward-incompatible changes are documented in [Magento 2.1 backward incompatible changes]({{ page.baseurl }}release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes-2.1.html).

## Highlights

Magento 2.1.2 contains multiple bug fixes and enhancements, including

* Support for <i>PHP 7.0.4 and 5.6.5</i>. (This release supports PHP 5.6.5 and above instead of 5.6.x.)


* Compatible with <i>MySQL 5.7</i>.


* <i>Two new web APIs (or service contracts) for the Sales module</i> that incorporate functionality into the Sales API that is currently available in the Admin interface. After you install this patch, you’ll be able to use the Sales API `ShipOrder` and `InvoiceOrder` methods to capture payment and ship product. See <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}mrg/intro.html" target="_blank">Module Reference Guide</a> for information on using the `ShipOrder` and `InvoiceOrder` interfaces.

### Why are we adding new APIs in a patch release?
{:.no_toc} 

<i>These new interfaces will not break any existing customizations or extensions.</i>  See <a href="https://alankent.me/category/magento/" target="_blank">Alan Kent’s blog about Magento</a> for more information about these features and Magento’s use of semantic versioning. 

## Security enhancements
This release includes enhancements to improve the security of your Magento software. While there are no confirmed attacks related to these issues to date, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. We recommend that you upgrade your existing Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

The following list provides an overview of the security issues fixed in this release. We describe each issue in greater detail in the <a href="https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2010-and-212-security-update" target="_blank">Magento Security Center</a>.

## Known issues


* **Issue**: Error creating configurable products in 2.1.1 <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6424" target="_blank">(GITHUB-6424)</a>. **Workaround**: Clear your browser cache after upgrading. 
<!--- 58017-->




* **Issue**: When you edit a configurable product and add options to a simple product, Magento does not save these options. **Workaround**: None.
<!--- 58034-->



* **Issue**: Logo for transactional emails cannot be uploaded successfully <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6275" target="_blank">(GITHUB-6275)</a>. **Workaround:** None.

<!--- 57291-->



* **Issue**: The `catalogProductRepository` API (REST) returns an unexpected attribute type. Certain `attribute_code` values (for example,  `category_ids`) return an array instead of the expected string. **Workaround**: As needed, adjust your code so that it handles the response as an array.  

<!--- 56853-->




* **Issue**:  Magento does not correctly display Product > Catalog table after upgrade from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0 on systems running Varnish. **Workaround**: Restart Varnish after upgrading.
